The following algorithms are included in this repository:

1. **Linear Regression**
   - Implementation of simple and multiple linear regression.

2. **Logistic Regression**
   - Binary classification using logistic regression.

3. **Decision Trees**
   - Building decision tree models for classification and regression tasks.

4. **Random Forests**
   - Ensemble learning using random forest algorithm.

5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
   - Implementation of SVM for classification tasks.

6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - Classifying data points based on distance metrics.

7. **Neural Networks**
   - Basic implementation of feedforward neural networks using libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

8. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm for unsupervised learning.
